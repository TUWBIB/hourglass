# Hourglass Theme for Janeway

## Minimum Janeway version

1.7

## Installing

1. Clone this repository into the theme folder of your
   [Janeway](https://github.com/BirkbeckCTP/janeway) installation
   (with the current minimum version):

   ```shell
   cd src/themes
   git clone git@github.com:BirkbeckCTP/hourglass.git
   ```

2. With your Python virtual environment activated, install the Python
   dependencies using pip.

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install the JavaScript dependencies using NPM:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

   You should see a new `node_modules` file in the `hourglass` folder.

4. Add the app name to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:

   ```py
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       ...,
       'themes.hourglass',
       ...,
   ]
   ```

5. Make changes to settings for `django-components`, mostly according to the
   [installation
   instructions](https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/django-components/tree/d9342782266b6ec41e3f2c39229d71d975f809a2#installation)
   However, do *not* apply caching with `loaders.cached.loader`. Instead,
   use these loaders:

   ```py
   'loaders': [
       'utils.template_override_middleware.Loader',
       'django.template.loaders.filesystem.Loader',
       'django_components.template_loader.Loader',
       'django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader',
   ],
   ```

6. Make changes to settings for `django_minify_html` if desired according to the
   [installation
   instructions](https://github.com/adamchainz/django-minify-html#installation)

## Deploying to production

From the Janeway root, build assets for all themes:

```shell
python src/manage.py build_assets
```

You can call the same command via NPM in the theme root:

```shell
cd src/themes/hourglass
npm run build
```

## Updating in production

```shell
cd src/themes/hourglass
git pull
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
python ../../manage.py build_assets
```

## Developing

### CSS

Use Tailwind classes in the HTML templates to apply styling.

In the rare case you need to apply a style to the base layer or define
a custom component, make changes to `src/input.css` using `@layer` and
`@apply` commands.

When making lots of small CSS changes that you want to see in the browser
during development, you can use the hot replacement (HMR) feature provided
by Tailwind. To watch for changes and recompile the CSS based on classes
used automatically, use this NPM command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

This should work smoothly with the `django-browser-reload` configuration
in Janeway so that you only have to save the HTML file you’re working in
to see the changes take place in the browser. Templates and static CSS
files are both watched and can trigger reloads independently.

#### Styling notes

Each section of content is given a container and relative positioning, so
that it can be used as an anchor for background colors and images.

Z-index is used as follows:

- `-z-10` for the solid light tan background

- `z-0`, `z-10`, and `z-20` for the constructivist collages of geometric shapes and cut-out photos

- `z-30` for pseudo-elements used to extend alternate color backgrounds
outside the container to the edge left and/or right

- `z-40` for the content layer, along with its immediate, in-container
background color

- `z-50` for the sticky desktop nav so it is persistent on top of
everything else

### JavaScript

Modify the files in `js` and rerun `build_assets`.

New files need to be added to `OTHER_SOURCE_FILES` in `build_assets.py`.

### Code styling and linting

The repository is set up with a few formatters and linters:

- [Standard](https://standardjs.com/) for JavaScript

- [djhtml](https://github.com/rtts/djhtml) for Django template file indentation,
  using 2-space-indents to better handle long Tailwind class lines

Please run these two commands before pushing:

```shell
standard --fix
djhtml --tabwidth 2 templates
```

We haven’t enforced them as a pre-commit hook, because we’d need to
discuss the implications of that first.

## Copyediting and Content Changes

All the content for this theme is stored in GitHub, rather the Janeway content
management system. You can propose changes in GitHub by following these steps:

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account and that you’ve been added to an OLH
   GitHub team with the right access.

2. Make sure you have a Janeway account for the installation that you want
   to edit and that your account has staff access.

3. While logged in to the website, find the live page you want to edit,
   and click on the “Edit on GitHub” link. You should be taken to the
   GitHub page with the source code. You should also see the name of the
   branch at the top of the page, after the file path.

4. Edit the file, and then select “Commit changes”. Enter a commit
   message, and leave “Commit directly to the copyediting branch”
   selected. Select “Commit changes”.

5. Open a pull request from the copyediting branch to the main branch. Or
   just ask a member of the tech team to do so for you. They will review
   your edits and merge them into the live version of the website.

## Changing a link to a media file

You can change a hyperlink to a Word doc or PDF like this:

1. Upload the new file to the appropriate
   [Media Manager in Janeway](https://janeway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manager/content/index.html?highlight=media%20manager#media-files).
   
3. Copy the link Janeway gives you, and then paste it in to the appropriate
   page using the steps above for Copyediting and Content Changes. For example,
   in this line, you'd just replace the whole URL from "https" to ".doc". Keep the
   quotes around the link.
